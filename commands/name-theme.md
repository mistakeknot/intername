description: Switch the active naming theme — culture, demarch, nato, or custom
argument-hint: "[culture | demarch | nato | custom]"

Switch between naming theme packs or view available themes.

## Workflow

### 1. Load Naming Library

```bash
INTERNAME_PLUGIN=$(find ~/.claude/plugins/cache -path "*/intername/*/hooks/lib-naming.sh" 2>/dev/null | head -1)
if [[ -z "$INTERNAME_PLUGIN" ]]; then
    echo "Intername plugin not found."
    exit 0
fi
source "$INTERNAME_PLUGIN"
```

### 2. Handle Arguments

**No arguments:** Show all available themes and which is active:

```
Available themes:
  * culture  — Dry wit, polite menace, bureaucratic absurdity (25 agents, 5 agencies)
    demarch  — Boundary concepts, diplomatic terms, liminal vocabulary (25 agents, 5 agencies)
    nato     — Short, distinctive, unambiguous phonetic names (25 agents, 5 agencies)
    custom   — Your own names (0 agents, 0 agencies)

Active: culture
Custom overrides: enabled
```

Read each theme file from `data/themes/` to count agents/agencies and extract the description from `_meta`.

**Theme name argument:** Validate the theme file exists at `data/themes/<arg>.json`. If valid, update `data/config.json` to set `"theme": "<arg>"`. Show the change:

```
Theme switched: culture → demarch

Sample names:
  fd-safety       → Sentinel (was: Lapsed Pacifist)
  fd-correctness  → Arbiter (was: Conditions Apply)
  flux-drive      → Threshold Caucus (was: The Difficult Second Album)
```

If the theme file doesn't exist:
```
Unknown theme "<arg>". Available: culture, demarch, nato, custom.
```

### 3. Custom Overrides Toggle

If the user asks to enable or disable custom overrides, update `data/config.json` field `"customOverrides"`. Custom overrides layer on top of any theme — entries in `custom.json` take precedence.

# intername Philosophy

## Purpose
Agent and agency naming for legible orchestration — memorable, deterministic identities across all surfaces. 4 themes: Culture (Banks-style), Demarch (diplomatic), NATO (phonetic), custom.

## North Star
Every agent should be instantly recognizable by name across all surfaces.

## Working Priorities
- Name uniqueness (no collisions within a session)
- Memorability (two syllables, evocative)
- Determinism (same agent gets same name across sessions)

## Brainstorming Doctrine
1. Start from outcomes and failure modes, not implementation details.
2. Generate at least three options: conservative, balanced, and aggressive.
3. Explicitly call out assumptions, unknowns, and dependency risk across modules.
4. Prefer ideas that improve clarity, reversibility, and operational visibility.

## Planning Doctrine
1. Convert selected direction into small, testable, reversible slices.
2. Define acceptance criteria, verification steps, and rollback path for each slice.
3. Sequence dependencies explicitly and keep integration contracts narrow.
4. Reserve optimization work until correctness and reliability are proven.

## Decision Filters
- Does this make multi-agent output more legible?
- Does this help humans track which agent said what?
- Is the naming deterministic and collision-free?
- Does the theme fit the project's tone?
